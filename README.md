# Taz6_BTT_Octopus_V1.1_F445_Klipper_BLTouch_CB1+PI4B Linear Rails

Update: 10-9-2024 : I am in the process of adding Y linear mgn12h rails.  Once its completed, I will add the parts to Printables and add all other info here.

Update: Removed KAMPS for now, was a fight, might come back later, bed would scrape on certain parts, no good, no good
        ADDED: Sensorless Homing for BTT EZ2209 Drivers, (Diag pin is weird, couldn't find much info, seems a lot of people were struggling, so here you go, I tried to do some of the heavy lifting) I added Photos for reference and updated the Config file as well to work with sensorless homing.  Upcoming: Hopefully..., I can get auto gantry homing to work with the sensorless homing.  If I do, I will upload and share :)

Update: Project is complete,  100% working! :)

Update: I have changed the design of the gantry and altered the files from the CAD model and added MGN15H linear rails, I will upload them when I'm confident they work as expected.

Update: Uploaded some of the models to: https://www.printables.com/model/850220-lulzbot-taz-6-x-linear-rails-mod

I have printed a calibration cube, a cup, and a retraction settings test, and lots others.  All printed just fine, but as usual, make sure to check the pinout of your hardware. 

I added a few photos to hopefully help anyone on where to place any wiring, etc.  These photos are for reference only, as some tweaking on the config will/may be done before/after they have been uploaded
